# Viewership-Analysis
ðŸ“Œ What the Project is About

This project is focused on analyzing viewership data to understand audience behavior, engagement, and content performance. The dataset contains records of what users watched, when they watched it, how long they watched, and from which device or region.

The analysis will help answer questions like:

Which programs/content are the most popular?

How long do users typically watch content?

What devices/platforms are viewers using the most?

Are there regional or time-based trends in viewing?

ðŸ“Œ Why EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)?

EDA is the first step in any data science or analytics workflow. Here, it will:

Explore the data structure (columns, datatypes, missing values, duplicates).

Clean the data (handle nulls, standardize formats, remove inconsistencies).
Use Python libraries to do Exploloratory data analysis process and data visualisation.

Summarize patterns using statistics and visualizations.

Reveal insights into user engagement, program trends, and viewing behavior.

ðŸ“Œ End Goal of the Project

The ultimate goal of this analysis is to:

Understand audience behavior â€“ when, how, and what users watch.

Identify popular content and platforms â€“ optimize programming and distribution strategies.

Highlight engagement trends â€“ peak times, binge-watching patterns, or regional differences.

Build a foundation for advanced analytics â€“ such as forecasting viewership, recommending content, or driving business decisions.
